I'm happy to announce that Version 3 of `react-native-scrollable-navigation-bar` is released. This version comes with a lot of new features, but most importantly, it comes with a documentation.

The new features include but are not limited to:

- Support for all Platforms
- 60 FPS
- More intuitive API
- More customization

I will continue to work on this package now regularly, therefore feel free to open issues for requests of new featuers.
